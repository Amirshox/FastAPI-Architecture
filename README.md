# FastAPI Serverless Architecture Project

## Introduction

This project demonstrates a serverless architecture implemented with FastAPI, aiming to provide a scalable and efficient
backend solution. The architecture is organized into various modules, including API routes, database models, and service
classes, promoting clean code practices and easy maintenance.

## Features

- **API Versioning**: Supports versioning to accommodate future changes seamlessly.
- **Service Layer Abstraction**: Includes a robust service layer for business logic separation.
- **Database Models**: Utilizes SQLAlchemy for ORM with asynchronous support.
- **Authentication**: Implements basic authentication mechanisms.
- **Pagination**: Offers utility functions for data pagination.
- **Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling for database integrity and transaction management.
